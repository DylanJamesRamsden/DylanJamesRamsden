✨ Hi fellow Keyboard Smashers, I am Dylan James Ramsden ✨

I am a junior gameplay programmer, who graduated with a BCIS in Game Design and Development in 2020. I am currently doing freelance gameplay programming for a studio
in Cape Town, South Africa as well as work for Origin Story Games, Norway.

My interests include gameplay systems (my favorite so far being a building system I recently did for an up and coming game) and creating more engaging and interesting interactions between the player and the game world they find themselves in.

I am very comfortable in C# (and Unity) and have spent the past 2 years learning and working with C++ (and Unreal Engine). I believe I am slowly and surely becoming
a very strong gameplay programmer and to ensure I do, I am always working on coding demo's and trying new things, so please feel free to follow my progression.
