✨ Hi fellow Keyboard Smashers, I am Dylan James Ramsden ✨

I am a gameplay programmer, with 3 years industry experience, having been a part of shipping 1 title and having worked on multiple unreleased titles.

My interests include gameplay mechanics and creating more engaging and interesting interactions between the player and the game world they find themselves in.

I am very comfortable with Unreal Engine 4/5 (C++ and Blueprints) as well as Unity (C#). What matters to me most is that every day I learn something new with a focus on becoming better at what I do! And I wholeheartedly believe there is no better way to spend my time than building kick-ass games!
